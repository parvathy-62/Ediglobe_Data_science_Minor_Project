COVID-19 Early Case Trend Analysis &amp; Recovery Insights
# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling on COVID-19 patient data using Python.

## Objectives
- Analyze gender and age distribution
- Identify regions with high infection counts
- Study infection sources
- Analyze recovery time distribution
- Perform correlation analysis
- Apply linear regression to study factors affecting recovery time

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels

## Dataset Details
The dataset includes patient demographics, infection source, regional data, and recovery information.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Run the script:

## Key Findings
- Average recovery time is ~15 days
- Gender distribution is nearly balanced
- Certain regions show higher infection concentration
- Recovery time shows weak correlation with age and contact history
- Linear regression indicates no statistically significant predictors due to limited recovery samples

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates practical use of Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and basic statistical modeling.
